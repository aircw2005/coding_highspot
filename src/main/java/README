How to scale PlayListApp application in real production.

1. For very large input files, try to divide the file into mulitiple chunks, and the application will read each
chunk into a separate storage (e.g. MongoDB table) and aggregate them. Since there are more than 1 input files,
more threads can be spawn to make the operations concurrent.

2. For very large change files, the changes can also be broken down into different input chunks, and then apply
each chunk to the stored playlist data.
